note right of Router
  Intelligent routing based on:
  - Request type
  - Model availability
  - Quality requirements
  - Cost constraints
end note

note right of QC
  Quality checks include:
  - Content safety
  - Output coherence
  - Technical quality
  - User satisfaction
end note

note right of Aggregator
  Combines outputs from:
  - Multiple models
  - Different modalities
  - Quality levels
  - User preferences
end note
