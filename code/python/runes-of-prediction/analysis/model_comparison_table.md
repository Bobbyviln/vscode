# Generative Model Comparison Table

| MODEL NAME | TYPE | ARCHITECTURE | STRENGTHS | LIMITATIONS | EXAMPLE USE CASE |
|------------|------|--------------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| GPT-4 | Text | Transformer | Long context (128K tokens), fluent reasoning, multimodal capabilities | High compute cost, closed-source, potential hallucinations | AI assistants, creative writing, code generation, knowledge work |
| LLaMA 3 | Text | Transformer | Open weights, efficient for local deployment, strong reasoning | Less instruction-tuned than GPT-4, requires fine-tuning for specific tasks | Research, chatbots, language modeling, local AI applications |
| Claude 3 | Text | Transformer | Strong reasoning, low hallucination rate, constitutional AI | Closed-source, limited API access, higher latency | Legal document analysis, research assistance, content moderation |
| Stable Diffusion XL | Image | Latent Diffusion Model | High-quality output, open-source, customizable, fast inference | May introduce visual artifacts, requires careful prompting | Album covers, character design, concept art, marketing visuals |
| DALLÂ·E 3 | Image | Transformer + Diffusion | High prompt fidelity, seamless composition, safety filters | Closed-source, hosted only by OpenAI, limited customization | Product renders, editorial illustration, brand-safe content |
| Midjourney v6 | Image | Proprietary Diffusion | Highly aesthetic, stylized outputs, strong artistic quality | No API, no model weights, subscription required | Marketing campaigns, conceptual design, artistic illustration |
| Runway Gen-2 | Video | Diffusion | Text-to-video generation, easy interface, good motion | Some consistency/frame coherence issues, limited duration | Short promos, mood reels, marketing content |
| ModelScope T2V | Video | Transformer + Diffusion | Open-source, early-stage but improving, customizable | Resolution and motion limitations, requires more compute | Experimental T2V, creative content, research applications |
| Pika Labs | Video | Diffusion | High-quality video generation, good motion consistency | Limited duration, subscription model, closed-source | Short-form content, social media videos, concept visualization |
| Tortoise TTS | Audio | Transformer | Emotion-rich voice cloning, multiple styles, high quality | Slower inference times, requires significant compute | Audiobook narration, character dialogue, voice assistants |
| MusicGen | Audio | Transformer | Text-to-music with melody control, open-source | Limited music genres and instruments, basic structure | Lo-fi music, game soundtrack prototyping, background scoring |
| Whisper | Audio | Transformer | Accurate speech recognition, multilingual, robust | No voice generation, transcription only | Speech-to-text, podcast transcription, accessibility tools |
| DreamFusion | 3D | Diffusion + NeRF | Coherent 3D shape from text, novel view synthesis | Requires high VRAM, slow training, limited detail | AR/VR prototyping, 3D concept generation, game assets |
| Magic3D | 3D | Diffusion + NeRF | High-quality 3D generation, better detail than DreamFusion | Still requires significant compute, limited control | 3D modeling, architectural visualization, product design |
| Point-E | 3D | Diffusion | Fast 3D generation, point cloud output | Lower quality than NeRF-based models, limited detail | Rapid prototyping, 3D scanning, educational tools |
